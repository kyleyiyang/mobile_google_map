Make sure the mobile version of the site has the google maps (which should also show up at the top of the page on search results on mobile)
Moved the google map div from bottom up to be on top of search results:

<div class="search-location-line"></div>
	  <div id="google_canvas_wrap">
    <div id="google_canvas"></div>
</div>
Saved in: /page-search-location-mobile-with-map.php
